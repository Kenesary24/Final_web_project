I created this website for my final web programming exam.

## About the project

This is an information site dedicated to the game **Red Dead Redemption 2** — one of the most atmospheric and popular games from Rockstar Games studio. Here you will find:

-  The history and plot of the game
-  Open world and locations
-  Characters and weapons
-  Animals and hunting
-  Gallery 

## Technology

The website is designed using:

- **HTML5** - page structure  
- **CSS3 / Tailwind** - style and adaptability  
- **JavaScript** - dynamic content
- **JSON**


## How to launch
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rdr2-website.git
```

Откройте index.html в браузере

## Attention
Due to the large volume of the image files, only a portion was uploaded, and if some images don't load when the site is launched, that's fine.
